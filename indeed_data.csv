This role will involve working with teams and individuals across King - such as Game Developers, Producers and Game Artists, so excellent communication skills are essential. You will also need: Product insight: You will need to combine an understanding of player behaviour based on the data with the ability to understand the problems in our game and business, in order to provide the best recommendations and decisions Technical skills: We make intensive usage of SQL, cloud services, and the Python analytical stack, so having prior experience in at least two of these domains is definitely a plus. A good grasp of applied statistics (especially to time series) might also be very helpful Communication: Designing good ways of communicating, visualising or reporting your results/analysis so they are clear and unambiguous. Your insights will need to be digested by people with diverse degrees of numerical proficiency, so getting the right message across to different audiences is a very interesting challenge. Bonus Points  There is plenty of scope at King for you to learn from your colleagues in the areas where you have less experience, and to share your own skills where you are stronger.  Specific prior experience that might be helpful, but is not required, includes: Experience in the games industry or similarly sophisticated customer- facing digital businesses  Cloud- based big data solutions such as Redshift, BigQuery  Behavioural psychology/economics  Robust understanding of more advanced statistical techniques suitable for analysis of highly skewed populations  Experience in predictive analytics, segmentation, and related area  Experience in experimental design  Software engineering skills in languages beyond R and Python which we use most frequently  Standard reporting tools such as Looker/Tableau/etc.  A Great Saga Needs All Sorts of Heros Making games is fun.

Senior Data Scientist,Agrimetrics,Harpenden,NA,NA,"CAREERS Senior Data Scientist Reading or Harpenden · Full Time Role Description and Person Specification: As a Senior Data Scientist, reporting to a Data Science Team Leader, you will join a team with a mix of backgrounds in complex domains like agrifood and life sciences, with skills across computing and statistics. You will develop analytical capabilities, predictive models and data processing pipelines that embed analytics and insights into our, and our customers', daily operations. About Agrimetrics Mission Agrimetrics is funded by UK Government to catalyse the whole UK agrifood industry through the power of big data and advanced analytics.  The agrifood sector faces critical challenges: how do farmers sustainably intensify agricultural production to produce more from less; and how do all players manage risk and build resilience in increasingly fragile, international supply chains?  Whilst the industry collects plenty of data, these datasets are often not electronic or are trapped in siloes within disjointed research, corporate or farm management databases. The sector remains very immature in deriving valuable insights through sharing and integrating data and using machine learning applied across large quantities of data for modelling and predictive analytics. Products, services and customers Agrimetrics is creating the world's first Data Marketplace for the agrifood sector. This is underpinned by a knowledge graph linking open and private data relevant to farming. Our first product set – Field Explorer – links these data to field polygons that were developed by applying AI algorithms to earth observation (EO)/satellite data.  Customers include:Third party application developers like Glas Data, who connect with the Data Marketplace through REST and GraphQL APIs and can build their own farmer-facing applications using our trusted data. Corporate data scientists like Barfoots, who can use our data in combination with their own data from farming operations within analytics that answer key business questions, like predicting when a crop will be ready for harvest. Academics and researchers like the pan-Europe SmartCow programme, who collaborate around shared and linked data resources to improve reusability and repurposing of research data. Future data products and services will allow different types of companies across the agrifood supply chain (agri-supply/agri-techs, agronomists, farmers, processors, distributors, retailers) to explore more data, examine data flexibly through different concepts and lenses, and use our Data Marketplace as the go-to resource for exposing their own data and models for exploitation across the market. Funding Agrimetrics operates as a start-up – the vast majority of our development and data science efforts are novel and qualify for R&D tax credits. But we are not beholden to fickle investment funding rounds, and Agrimetrics has a clear runway based on grant funding agreements from Innovate UK [1] . Agrimetrics is structured as a ""private company limited by guarantee without share capital"", so does not answer to shareholders.
