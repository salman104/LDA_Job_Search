# LDA_Job_Search
Scraping Indeed for job adverts and applying NLP and LDA modelling

The notebook is divided into 3 sections:

1. Scraping data from indeed using Beautiful Soup
2. Analysing the job postings
3. Cleaning the data and applying topic modelling

For now I've only scraped jobs in Greater London as that's relevant to myself but I could also scrape jobs 
from other locations in the UK to increase the data set.
